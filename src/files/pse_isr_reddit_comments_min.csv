While I‚Äôd presume the war hasn‚Äôt made things easier for the hospital, it is clear Hamas was already diminishing its capacity and capabilities by using it as a base. In addition to hoarding scarce resources, Hamas repurposed space in the hospital for their needs; for example a large store of ammunition and grenades were found hidden behind an MRI machine, which prevents the machine from operating at all.",worldnews,2023-11-18 22:53:58+00:00

A lot of Palestinians had their homes taken from them in order to construct the settlements and want them back. This also includes farms. Some of these grievances go back decades and not everyone will be happy, which is where such a proposal may fall apart in practice.
I propose a mechanism by which these ""land grievances"" can be submitted and reparations can be mediated by a court. So for example, maybe some people are entitled to a home somewhere or they receive monetary compensation instead.

This is the just of my problem with Israel, and trust me I know many Israelis agree, but I don't think you guys do enough to stop it, nor do you realize how deep the implications of it run.

Not only is the occupation and oppression of the West Bank illegal under international law, but it fuels the fire of the greatest threat to Israel's existence.

The occupation:

1. Shifts West Bank public support away from Fatah/PA (because they are either complicit or powerless with the occupation)
2. Shifts that public support to armed resistance, which at the moment, is only the terrorist group Hamas (only Hamas exists because Israel wouldn't allow a a group of armed resistance to rise in the West Bank as it contradicts their agenda, such a group would be labelled as terrorists)
3. Allows Hamas to seize and manipulate the moral high ground the innocent Palestinians hold to support their terrorist agendas
4. Shifts Israeli security force from defending against the actual threat to their nation (Hamas in Gaza), to imposing a war crime on another region that ironically shifts public support to the real threat that is Hamas",IsraelPalestine,2023-11-18 22:41:40+00:00

k9tgw4k,1,"Since 1995, the Arab population in Judea and Samaria has lived under the sovereignty of an independent Palestinian government. The Palestinian Authority is actually a state with partial sovereignty. The Palestinians have a government, a legal system, representations all over the world, and even Palestinian citizenship, which was granted, among other things, to Daniel Birnbaum. Israel does indeed control the international crossings between the Palestinian Authority and Jordan, and it sometimes imposes restrictions on movement between West Bank cities for security reasons, but difference of control of crossings due to a security need and apartheid is very big.

In truth, there is apartheid in Judea and Samaria: apartheid by the Palestinian Authority against Jews and Christians. A Jew is not allowed to purchase land from an Arab, and the punishment for an Arab who sells land to a Jew is death. Bethlehem is being emptied of its Christian population, which suffers from acute discrimination. In Ramallah, the law does not prohibit a Jew from entering a movie theater, but in practice he risks his life if he does so.

The Palestinian Authority is not unusual in the Arab world. All Arab countries, from Morocco to Iraq, are apartheid countries, that is, countries that officially pursue a policy of discrimination against the non-Muslim minorities. In Sudan, for example, there is apartheid against blacks and Christians. The genocide in Darfur was an extreme and cruel example of ethnic cleansing and apartheid. Since 1983, more than two million black Sudanese have been deported and murdered by Sudan's Arab government. Syria, Iraq and Iran pursue an apartheid policy against the Kurdish people. In 1962, the Syrian government revoked the citizenship of hundreds of thousands of Kurds, and in 2008 expelled the Kurds from what it calls the ""Arab strip"" of Syria. In the same year, the government also denied the Kurds the right to purchase land. The Kurds suffer similar discrimination in Iran, not to mention Iraq. In 1988, Saddam Hussein destroyed about 5,000 Kurds with chemical weapons.


The Palestinians themselves suffer from apartheid in the Arab countries. They are only allowed to live in camps, and they are forbidden to engage in many professions. In Lebanon, the law prohibits Palestinians from practicing medicine, law, banking and teaching. They are not allowed to own private property and enroll their children in schools. The apartheid policy of the Arab countries caused the immigration of about two million Christians from the Middle East in the last twenty years. In Egypt, Copts suffer discrimination and persecution. Jews and Christians cannot obtain citizenship in Saudi Arabia. In Jordan, Jews are not allowed to purchase land. In Saudi Arabia there is apartheid also against women; They are not allowed to drive and vote in municipal elections.",IsraelPalestine,2023-11-18 22:34:49+00:00

Of note, both my parents had to flee from such states due to persecution of Jews. After the holocaust, Jews were not allowed to return to their home countries in Europe, and had nowhere  else to go. Israel was created out of necessity - we had nowhere else to go. And it‚Äôs not Europeans after the holocaust, about half of Israel are from or descended from Arab countries that were/are no longer accepting of the Jews. 

Israel is just about the size of Delaware, it‚Äôs very small. Why is it such an extreme thought that Jews deserve even the smallest land to call their own? And I am a huge proponent of a two solution in the creation of a Palestinian state, because Palestinians are suffering and deserve a fulfilling and wholesome life full of opportunity. This idea is not contrary to Zionism. Most Jews and Zionist are overwhelmingly against expanding settlements in the Westbank, something to the extreme right is trying to do an Israel. We just want peace and to be safe. Please don‚Äôt conflate our beliefs with the actions of the Israeli government, just as you shouldn‚Äôt conflate the actions of Hamas with innocent Palestinian citizens.",IsraelPalestine,2023-11-18 22:32:40+00:00

I don‚Äôt understand how the world can‚Äôt see how heartbreaking that day was.  Israel has a right to declare war.  I do not want the innocent people of Gaza to die or live like they are living. But I can‚Äôt judge Israel because I didn‚Äôt live that day.  

I do feel like Israel and US is playing into hamas hand.  They did this to gain sympathy from around the world.  To weaken the us and Israel with its Allies. They pretty much have been putting their people in harms way knowing the consequences as leaders sit comfortably in another country.  Probably living in a mansion.  I understand the anger from both sides.  But we have to do better.

I do feel like the privileged college kids and Me too movement are ignoring the questions when asked about Oct 7th.  In order for change and peace people need to own and point out that Oct 7th was despicable and nothing justified that. I think the people of Israel need to hear that.

Your post seems to suggest that the Israeli government, alone among governments of the world, is uniquely above reproach completely, because that could only be because of anti-Semitism. Standing up for the human rights of millions of Palestinians isnt allowed, because that would just be anti-Semitism, so ISrael must be able to treat Palestinians however they want to, or its anti-semitism.   


In your view, what criticism of the policies of the Israeli government allowed, without it being anti-semitism  


I'm someone with enough Jewish ancestry to have a right of return to Israel. I also oppose China's treatrment of the Uyghers. I also oppose Russia treatment of the Ukranians, and support Ukraine aid. I also oppose our complicitness in one of the largest humanitarian disasters in history, which is the war in Yemen. I dont see how any of these things are mutually exclusive. How do I fit into your narrative? I thought if you supported the human rights of the Palestinians, you could also care about these other causes.  


&gt;he comically stupid cliches (genocide, ethnic cleansing, apartheid) don't stand up because once u drill down to each one of them they don't stand up to scrutiny or the real meanings of those phrases. . 

What matters isnt if what is happening to the Palestinians fits into a certain phrase, wehat matters is what is literally happening top the Palestinians. They have been subjigated and denied self determionation (whether in their own country, or as citizens of ISrael) for 70 years. The west bank looks like you want into a time machine and back into the colonial settler are in the American west.

k9tfkdg,1,"No harm done about the Yossef Mizrahi.

I'm sure bombing their homes is one of the factors that can lead one to become a terrorist, but I think attributing it all to that is kinda being a racist of low expectations. 

I'll give you a small example. Many people who were brutally murdered on October 7th were actually some of the only far left Israelis left in Israel. They really went through some of the most horrible ordeals one can think about. Atrocities like that might make you very hateful towards Hamas and many of the other Palestinians who joined them on their carnage. Yet you can find videos of survivors still clinging to the path of peace. 

https://youtu.be/c74Zdvpt5xc?si=4dmO-xarpW8aPweS

It's true Hamas wasn't really a thing before 2005 (it was established and active before but let's say for the sake of argument you are right). But we had Fatah before that sending suicide bombers to explode busses and teen night clubs. And before that we had other terror attacks.

You say 75 years so you refer to the Nakba, but I think that the conflict is longer than that. Palestinians murdered many Jews in the 20s in 36-39, and in 47. 

The fact the Palestinians are weaker here doesn't automatically make them right. Because I don't think they are. That is not to say the people of Gaza deserve what they get, not at all. But when this is the kind of people you support, when you educate your children to hate and when you pay money for people to slaughter Jews (that one isn't Hamas it's actually Fatah on the west bank the 'moderate' ones) that's what you get. 

I'm sure the Israeli bombing them is part of it. But to pretend it's only that is racism of low expectations.",IsraelPalestine,2023-11-18 22:24:50+00:00

Settlers aren't doing anything wrong whilst in Israel. They are just citizens, the crimes occur when they are forcibly displacing Palestinians in the west bank.  


Hamas are doing wrong while not in Israel. They are terrorists committing crimes as they bomb civilians.

It also needs to be said that the 12,000 casualty numbers are sourced from the Gazan health ministry, which doesn't differentiate between civilians and combatants. It also doesn't count some percentage of the combatants who die in the north of the strip and never make it to a hospital or morgue. (And small correction, Al-Qussam brigades - the Hamas military arm - are actually estimated to be 30,000 to 40,000 combatants. Not 25,000 and definitely not including the political arm.)

If around 1200 deaths on the israeli side legitimise the bombing of gaza to rubble with subsequent invasion (ground offensive is an amazingly diplomatic way of putting it, but lets not beat around the bush here) and increase of violence in the west bank, what does 10.000+ civilian casualties legitimise as far as opinions and political support go? You understand that emotions are high and its difficult for people to give a calm response on both side right?

Israel cant call itself a democracy when it has dominated the entire lives of all of the Palestinians, and they cant vote. They are relegating Palestinians into the West Bank to smaller and smaller disconnected enclaves. This is rather similar to native Americans being relegated to reservations in America, could America really be considered a full democracy before we gave them citizenship?

People need to keep in mind most RPGs (including the Palestinian knockoff of the Soviet RPG-2 and RPG-7 series) are around ~100cm/39 inches length wise. That's unwieldy especially with a ~7kg warhead in a small apartment room where there might be furniture and other junk around. Which means your average terrorist needs to maneuver the launch tube in a position where he's going to be spotted (unless presighted and positioned) when aiming.

Having any amount of lead fired in your direction is really going to ruin your aim highlighting the importance of infantry eyes and support of even heavily armored vehicles in urban combat. Even if the suppression fires don't nail the RPG gunner, they can mark the building for further indirect fires by aircraft or artillery.

Which often leads to high civilian casualties since the terrorists have learnt to fire from buildings containing live civilians.

k9tcvyc,1,"&gt;Hamas is the enemy. But the people of Gaza were the ones who elected Hamas - an internationally recognized terrorist group - to be their leaders, and have kept it that way since. So the people of Gaza are complicit. This doesn't mean I want them all to die. But I'm not going to cry too hard for them.

What kind of retarded logic is this? First of all, only about 40% of Gazans elected Hamas. Anyone who doesn't want Hamas does NOT have the option to leave because Israel denies them the right to leave. They need to get a permit from the Israeli government to be able to leace the strip and it is NOT a permanent permit, it's more like a day pass.

Also, by your logic, electing successive far-right terrorists into office and government makes all Israelis complicit. Or is it the usual double standards?

&gt;See above. Specifically, the ""This doesn't mean I want them all to die."" part.

Oh, how very humane of you. Do you give them permission to exist in your vicinity as well or should they be out of sight, out of mind?

&gt;
If they go far enough, sure. If they stop half-way, no. In a way, it's like a person taking antibiotics. You need to take the full course of antibiotics- stopping halfway makes things worse in the long run. And stopping before Hamas is completely destroyed will let them recruit and rebuild and make things worse in the long run.

Again, by that logic, Hamas and the Palestinians should not stop until they've destroyed every last terrorist setller, cilonizer, land-thieving European reject.


&gt;There have been numerous plans offered to solve this issue. Several times Israel has offered a 2-state deal. The Palestinians have refused all of them. The Palestinians want it all- 'From the river to the sea', and want all the Jews dead. They are the ones ""denying any sort of equality"".

That's an outright lie. Not a single ""offer"" or plan included removal of settler, defining of any form of borders, any form of sovereignty, autonomy, or self-determination. 

Israel continued building in areas A, B and C before, during, and after all peace talks. Annexing more and more of the West Bank. There was an outright refusal of right of return. The West Bank was to be demilitarized while living next to settler militias.

The border with Jordan was to remain under Israeli control, basically giving Israel full control of Palestinian's movement. 

The apartheid wall, which zigzags through Palestinian lands, was to stay. The buffer zone for the wall that Palestinians are not allowed to go near is in Palestinian land. Highways that carve up the West Bank that are exclusive to Israelis was to stay. The checkpoints within the West Bank were to stay because settlements sometimes block off 2 areas or towns in the West Bank. So again, Israel has full control over the movement of Palestinians even within the West Bank. 

In short, take your Hasbara and repeat it to the idiots that don't know the history of the land, the war, the zionist occupation, and lies.

k9tcjvj,1,"A. ) it is well known that Hamas operates an extremely powerful propaganda machine and has utter control by fear of death of not just the perpetrator, but their family and extended families as well if you speak out against the current government in Gaza, Hamas.

&amp;#x200B;

B. ) It is largely seen as a powerful, strong country vs. an oppressed, poor people, as well as white/european appearing peoples vs. brown people.

&amp;#x200B;

C. ) The reality. The verified, accurate history of the region is extremely distorted by short form clips online.  As short as I can make it, it probably won't be. Egyptian, Roman History, Biblical and archeological history(especially Judean coins) and records all prove that the Kingdom of Israel, with the lands of Judaea and Samaria all existed long before Palestine. The area of which is now Gaza, was named Philistine. The Romans overthrew the Jewish people and renamed the land that is now contested Syria-Palaestina. Then history continued. The people of mandate Palestine took on the national identity as Palestinians in 1923 to help their cause to maintain the land. The two state partition plan happened. The 1948 attack of the Arab League on the newly formed Israel, the second Nakba, which is referenced often and used to make Israel sound bad, well, let me break it to you, at the same time as 700,000 Palestinians where expelled/left freely as asked by their leaders... over 850,000 Arab Mizrahi Jews were kicked out of the rest of the Middle Eastern states, most where they lived for thousands of years. So really, I do not understand the emphasis placed on the Nakba as it similarly happened to the Jews, yet over 300,000 Arabs stayed in Israel, have now grown to over 2 million, of which  enjoy complete political, civil and religious rights in Israel. They sit on their Supreme Court, and fight in their military. Yet the middle eastern countries that expelled the Jews... none were able to return, and virtually none exist in those countries anymore. Those same countries all have very few if none as far as minorities go and have been cleansing Christians from their lands over the last 50 years. (That is also a very easy verification to make with a quick google search)

&amp;#x200B;

Israel after that war was faced with a choice. Build a strong military as they had no political power in the middle east, surrounded by enemies that had just attacked them with not so strong militaries yet strong political might. They chose the former. And various governments argued over the use of force and military to continuously threaten the countries that bordered them.

&amp;#x200B;

Multiple wars ensued, Israel always defending. Skip forward to 2005, Arafat died, and Israel pulled out of Gaza completely when Hamas was voted in. Israel even used the IDF to remove their zionist settlers from Gaza. Immediately after doing so, Hamas started launching rockets into Israel, and sending Palestinians into Israel with suicide vests (I'd recommend listening to the Son of Hamas interviews online -prior to this conflict about what Hamas does, and how they do it). So, what would any country do? Israel built a massive wall, and implemented a blockade and strict border crossings on Gaza. Israel STILL, though, while rockets are launched at them daily, saved only by the Iron Dome, send humanitarian aid, offer medical aid, and supply Gaza with both water and electricity. Why doesn't Gaza's government supply their people with those basic necessities? They receive over a billion a year. They give work permits to Palestinians to come work in Israel as there is no employment in Gaza. Israel has given tax-payer funded heart surgery to over 3,000 children from Gaza and surrounding nations. Gay Palestinians seek asylum in Israel as they are murdered in Gaza. The Arab Palestinians living in Israel, the 20% of their population? They have protected mosques where they can freely practice religion.

&amp;#x200B;

Anti Semitism has ALWAYS been strong. We are seeing the same horrifying language used against Jewish people worldwide now as was seen used by the Germans. It's disgusting. Disgusting to use no matter who you are referring to.

&amp;#x200B;

So why the history lesson? All of those details can easily be fact checked and confirmed. A background is needed because the rhetoric and lies being put out there by propaganda want you to think that Israel is an apartheid state, and is committing genocide. Apartheid.. well.. considering.. Israel supports a nation that launches rockets at them.. sends in children wearing suicide vests put on by those kids mothers.. gives aid, fuel, water and electricity.. and that Palestinians have full freedom living in Israel if they so choose to do so peacefully.. no. That is not apartheid. Genocide... a slap in the face to those who experienced real genocide. The deaths of Gazans is HORRIBLE, it is sad.. more Christians/minorities have been killed in the Middle East in the last 20 years.. look what is happening now in Myanmar.. where is the outcry.. where is the outcry now between what is happening in Armenia with Azerbaijan. Real genocide is what Stalin did to Ukrainians, what happened in the holocaust, what China is doing to the Uyghurs, what the US did to the Phillipines and Vietnam.. not the steady growth in population of Gazans, Arab Palestinians in Israel, and the Palestinians in the West Bank, regardless of their horrible life expectancy thanks to Hamas oppression.

&amp;#x200B;

A social media war is being launched right now. Short form information, trigger words such as 'babies' are used OFTEN to incite emotion, lack of ethical, honest journalism by most major outlets which rarely retract or issue apologies for reporting information wrong, inserting the colonialism argument that has dominated the north americas and europe of late, lack of context. Constant accusations of actual events in history without giving the full story of what led up to Israel's aggression. Or understanding why they've had to become so aggressive surrounded by nations who have ACTUAL intent and have ACTUALLY stated such in their declarations of state that they want to cleanse Jewish people from 'the river to the sea'. Whereas Israel's declaration of independence says that they want to live in the pursuit of peace and prosperity with their neighbours. People think/see white jews in America oppressing poor brown people in Gaza without realizing the amount of Mizrahi Arabic Jews that live in Israel. People blame Israel for Gaza's weakness when Hamas doesn't let them thrive or give them opportunity. Israel builds their people up, supports them, offers a life of freedom and represents the western values of the west in a small pocket of land in the Middle East. And all of those middle eastern countries do not want that.

&amp;#x200B;

D. ) The latest generation is probably one of the least educated generations. Social media dominates lives, over 30% of young people under 20 get their news from social media like Tik Tok, and look who owns Tik Tok. Multiple powers are at play in this. AI has reared its head. Somehow Osama Bin Laden is lauded as a saviour and a righteous man with good intent. What the hell happened?

&amp;#x200B;

E. ) Most people clearly are not educated in the contextual and extremely convoluted history of that land and the various governments that have argued how to go about finding peace properly. Zealots and fanatics are on both sides, the Jewish and the Arabs. But the average person just wants peace.

&amp;#x200B;

Ask yourself this? If Israel laid down their weapons, what would Hamas do? Well, they've stated repeatedly that they want to repeat Oct 7 again and again.

&amp;#x200B;

Before the terrorist attack on Oct 7th. Israel was not waging war against Gazans or Hamas. So I would venture rather safely, it's easy to say if Hamas laid down their weapons Israel would stop the offensive, the war they DID NOT start. Heck, they havn't even killed the hamas prisoners they captured. They will go to trial.

&amp;#x200B;

I kind of put most of this for the people who are stating that Hamas is right. And Israel is evil. Israel is not perfect. They have always been in a shit position from the start. I just hope people do a little more unbiased research, preferably from sources prior to this recent conflict, because the anti-semitism around the world is sickening.. and I absolutely condemn any islamaphobia as well. Only 2% of the world is Jewish. And it's not right to call for their existence to cease over a war they didn't start.

If this was about land they would have accepted one of the many two state solutions that have been proposed. They have refused every time,  even when offered 97% of their demands.  

Here's what those civilians think now:

Important poll:

[https://www.awrad.org/files/server/polls/polls2023/Public%20Opinion%20Poll%20-%20Gaza%20War%202023%20-%20Tables%20of%20Results.pdf](https://www.awrad.org/files/server/polls/polls2023/Public%20Opinion%20Poll%20-%20Gaza%20War%202023%20-%20Tables%20of%20Results.pdf)

This shatters the idea that Hamas isn't representative of most Palestinians or that they are under the thumb and would like to remove them. I'm not justifying the killings, but this is still important information;

* 75% of Palestinians support the attack on October 7th, while only 13% disapprove.
* 93% of Palestinians express very or somewhat positive sentiments about Islamic Jihad.
* 80% of Palestinians reject both the one and two- state solutions, and instead demand all the territory.
* Interestingly, when asked about the purpose of the October 7th attack, only 28% mentioned freeing Palestine, while 35% stated it was to stop Aqsa violations, also known as settler incursions.

Something I initially missed, which is hugely important, is the breakdown of Hamas support by the West Bank and Gaza.

In the West Bank, 61.9% are very positive about Hamas, while in Gaza, only 28.9% are. In total, 87.7% of the West Bank population has a positive sentiment towards Hamas, whereas only 59.6% of Gazans do. Meanwhile, only 10.2% of the West Bank population has a negative sentiment towards Hamas, while 39.3% of Gazans do.

The poll has roughly 95% confidence (two standard deviations).

This is the listed methodology:

&gt; From October 31 to November 7, Arab World for Research and Development (AWRAD) surveyed 668 Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, during the fourth week of the ongoing Gaza War. At the time of the poll, more than 10,000 Palestinians in Gaza and 185 in the West Bank had been killed, with 27,000 injured in Gaza and 2,500 in the West Bank. Additionally, 2,700 people were reported missing in Gaza, while 2,500 had been arrested in the West Bank.  
&gt;
&gt; During the survey, a significant number of residents in northern Gaza had been forcibly displaced or were in the process of moving south. The UN estimates that in the period the survey was conducted more than   1.5 million people, out of a total population of 2.3 million, were displaced. The Israeli ground invasion,initiated on October 28, persisted throughout the implementation of the survey.  
&gt;
&gt; The team conducted the survey through tablet-assisted, face-to-face interviews across the West Bank and   in shelters and households in the three ‚Äúsouthern‚Äù Gaza governorates (Deir Al Balah, Khan Younis, and Rafah) where people were presently residing. The poll‚Äôs sample includes all socioeconomic groups,ensuring equal representation of adult men and women, and is proportionately distributed across the West Bank and Gaza. With a 95% confidence interval, the margin of error for the poll is (¬±) 4%.",IsraelPalestine,2023-11-18 21:54:04+00:00

The reality is, the only way to achieve a secure ""Jewish State"" was always to disposses a large amount of locals. IF you read the private letters of zionist leaders, it was obvious to them even if the Arabs accepted the partion plan, they would need to dispossed Arabs from their state, as 40% of their population was Arab, and a Jewish majority would be demographically imperiled. The Zionist leaders also planned to expand their state and take more land from the Arabs.

I think a long term, two state solution requires removing both Hamas and the current right-wing Israeli government from power - neither will accept a compromise solution.  Netanyahu can be defeated at the polls, but Hamas won't allow elections and need to be removed by force.  So on the one hand, I agree with the Israeli's that a ground invasion to remove Hamas from political control of Gaza is necessary, but on the other the way they are pursuing the war is focused on degrading Hamas' capability to fight after the war rather than paving the way for a more moderate government in Gaza.  It is going to take years for Gaza to recover economically from this, so even if Hamas (or some other similarly radical group) maintains control there, it will take a very long time for them to be able to stage any kind of assault similar to October 7th again.

Quite literally a cop, as all sides had agreed to concept of international waters, but the guy who decided to claim part of the highway just decided to have his cake and eat it too.

Judging from the tone I presume that you support China's attempt to enlarge their claim/nine-dotted line or otherwise support China's hostile actions on international waters?

As long as China diplomatically agrees to the concept of international waters, they are in the wrong in quite literally all points of view to intercept a canadian plane over international waters, in addition to doing so in dangerous, unprofessional and reckless fashion. Whether the interception took closer to China than Canada is immaterial- What matters is that China broke agreed upon rules of international conduct and attempted to enforce a soft claim on international territory. Rules that China themselves have agreed to follow, on paper.

That kind of edging is dangerous, as if China chooses to disregard the concept of international waters, they will effectively lose all trade with West, and most likely will see a huge escalation in terms of armed conflicts, as at that point China would effectively claim all of pacific and would be required to attempt to enforce their claim.",NonCredibleDefense,2023-11-18 21:51:22+00:00

k9taxx6,1,"IMHO from someone who has been following the German ghetto Hamas provides for ‚Äútheir people,‚Äù I think they know what‚Äôs happening is them not truly living. Whether they believe Hamas is doing it themselves or that they believe what Hamas has said, that it‚Äôs Israel doing it to them, is still unknown. From what whisperedingaza.org and cut off Al Jazeera live interviews have shown, there are definitely people who know it IS Hamas. And 14,000 with work visas into Israel probably do too. Anyone who doesn‚Äôt have a family member who has a work visa might not, though the Al Jazeera interview with the little girl does give an inkling of how they might be watching this very experience and putting the dots together. Only time will really tell though. 

For context, my position is that this needed to have been done back in 2014 but Obama was not about to support it, the infrastructure and DIY Hamas has done since then is really what‚Äôs made this mission so deadly. In 2014 it was at least known it was happening enough to have reason to move ahead. 

From a non-military perspective, I don‚Äôt know if rushing into action was the best idea, the best explanation of that I‚Äôve gotten from my Israeli friends is that although in previous hostage situations, they have been less urgent in the desire to not take one life for another.. I mean.. one of the hostages there has been there for EIGHT YEARS.. so why jump? The best answer was that the number of hostages is astronomical in comparison to previous and the KINDS of hostages too, led to that urgency (there are hostages with cancer, aging hostages and such who need medication, hostages missing limbs, a baby who needs formula‚Ä¶ even I‚Äôm not hopeful most of these people are still alive.) In retrospect, with later knowledge, we might know the urgency was not helpful. Even all these days later, it‚Äôs feeling that way. But that argument is like wasting chemotherapy on someone if they just die anyway. 

The other aspect, too, is that there are rocket launch sites that needed to be taken down for Israeli civilian safety and so if they were in the position of taking those down, they had to evacuate anyway, that could have constituted for the inability to just do minimum and pause the rest.
